                ‍

              <h2>ARTICLE 3. USE OF THE SERVICES</h2>
              <h4> 3.1 Use of the Services</h4>
              <p>

                You shall comply with the terms and use restrictions, if any, set out in these present Terms, and in the Operating Policies. You shall be responsible for ensuring that your users also comply with said Terms and use restrictions. You shall not interfere with or disrupt operation of the Service and shall comply with the Agreement for access to and use of this service. When You use the LeadCrafter.ai API, You shall be responsible for your usage of the LeadCrafter.ai platform and shall limit your API calls to a reasonable volume. lempire reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to take any necessary action to address any improper use. You subscribe to the Services in your name and on your behalf, and You are not entitled to send via our Services promotional emails for a third-party, nor to assign the use of all or part of the Services to your own customers, even for free;

                As an indirect LeadCrafter.ai subscriber, You subscribe to the Services in Your name but on behalf of your own clients with the objective of managing and/or reselling LeadCrafter.ai to your clients. Specific Terms will be applicable to this usage, including that You must use sub-accounts to separate email traffic of your own clients using the Services and are responsible for the necessary support for the End Users.

                Depending on the pricing plan, users can connect multiple email addresses to each LeadCrafter.ai seat:

                Teams on the “Cold Email Starter” can connect up to 1 email address to each LeadCrafter.ai seat.
                Teams on the “Cold Email Pro” can connect up to 3 email addresses to each LeadCrafter.ai seat.
                Teams on the “Multichannel Expert” can connect up to 5 email address to each LeadCrafter.ai seat.
                Teams on the “Outreach Scale” can connect up to 15 email address to each LeadCrafter.ai seat.
                This option was only created to allow each LeadCrafter.ai seat to connect email addresses from the same person. This means combinations of first name and/or last name (there are no restrictions on the domain name).

                For example, a LeadCrafter.ai seat can connect, on the “Cold Email Pro” plan:

                john.doe@domain.app
                john.doe@domain.com
                john@domain.app
                john@domain.com
                Connecting email addresses from multiple people on the same LeadCrafter.ai seat is considered a violation of our terms of service.

                For example, a LeadCrafter.ai seat on the “Cold Email Pro” plan, will be considered in violation of our terms of service if the following emails are connected:

                john@domain.com
                lola@domain.com
                emily@domain.app
                matt@domain.app
                In the case of this violation, we reserve the right to disconnect the email addresses linked to an account and to terminate the account if the violation persists.

              <h4>3.2 Credentials</h4>

                We also reserve the right to temporarily limit your sending – which means that your daily and total emails sent will be limited in number and You will need to take the necessary measures to ensure that your practices comply with our Policy and requirements – before LeadCrafter.ai can lift the temporary sending limit and allow You to send your desired volumes. A temporary sending limit subsequent to a breach of your contractual obligations means that You will remain liable for the payment of the amounts contractually due during the limitation period despite the limitation on your email sending options and no refund whatsoever will be made.
              </p>

              <h2>ARTICLE 4. COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW</h2>

                <h2>ARTICLE 5. PLANS – FINANCIAL TERMS</h2>
              <p>
                We offer various options to our Clients, including free and paid plans, with or without a fixed commitment period. You can find these options and the relevant pricing on our website at: https://www.LeadCrafter.ai.com The pricing of these plans is available in US Dollars.

              <h4>5.1  Free plans</h4>
                Free plans are non paid subscriptions subject to use restrictions (maximum limits to the number of daily and monthly emails and support ticket requests, restriction on API calls, etc.); these use restrictions are set forth on our Website.

                You may at any time terminate your free plan or upgrade to a paid plan.‍

Fees for the Service consist of a fixed fee (« Minimum Annual Fee ») and a variable fee («Variable Fee »), if any, depending on the volume of emails processed on behalf of Client. Unless otherwise stated, the Minimum Annual Fee is non-cancelable and non-refundable for any reason whatsoever.

                Us or Yourself may terminate the plan at the end of each term (anniversary date), by giving prior a three (3) month notice. You will remain responsible to pay all amounts due to Us until the termination effective date. In the absence of such a termination, the plan shall be automatically renewed for the same fixed term, and You shall be invoiced according to the initial schedule payment not including any overage charges.

                Service Provider or Yourself may also terminate the plan in advance in the event the other Party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a notice of such breach, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination may be immediate in the event of the following circumstances: Client’s non-compliance with the Anti-Spam Policy in accordance with provisions of Article 6.3 of these present Terms; in the event of a breach of any laws and regulations ; in the event of a breach or attempted breach of the security of the Website; or, in the event of fraud or attempted fraud in connection with use of the Website or the Service.

              <h4>5.4 Common provisions for all paid plans</h4>
                The plan fees do not include the cost of equipment and Internet access enabling use of the Service, the costs of which shall be borne by You.

Client Account Services fees shall be invoiced when the purchase order is signed. They are non-cancelable and non-refundable.

                Any delay in payment (i) will allow us to recover and without notice late interest, any collections fees and other amounts as allowed by law and (ii) may immediately, after notice, temporarily suspend access to and use of the Service and/or terminate your subscription. All amounts payable are quoted excluding taxes. You shall pay any and all taxes imposed by any government on the amounts payable for the Services, or reimburse Us in the event We have paid such amounts, for which You are personally responsible.

                lempire reserves the right to change the Services fees by notifying You by email with at least a thirty (30) day notice. If You do not accept the new fees as notified to You, You shall cease all use of the Services on or before the last day of the monthly period already paid at the date of the notification and terminate your plan. For fixed term plans, the fees applicable are the ones in force on the date of your order; the new fees will be applicable to You only on the renewal date of your plan.

                You agree not to seek lempire's liability and not to dispute payment for the sending of Your emails, even in the event any of them are blocked by a third party and do not reach their recipient as You would have desired.

                at any time and for any legitimate reason for a free plan provided reasonable notice is given; or,
                after You have been notified by lempire following any breach of laws or regulations or these Terms, including but not limited to: if payment or partial payment of any sum due by You is not received by lempire; in the event of a payment incident; when using the Services to send emails that do not comply with the Sending Policy; in the event of a breach or attempted breach of the Website security; or, in the event of fraud or attempted fraud when using the Website.

              <h4>6.3 Consequences of the termination</h4>
